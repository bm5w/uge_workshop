git blame unix_notes.txt
    useful for determining why someone put changes there

each commit has a label:
    head: points to most recent commit
    master: points to first branch (created by git init)

    branch: is a label that points to a specific place in time
    make a branch: git branch
        adds a new label to current commit, it does not check out that branch
git branch git-notes
    creates another label that points at the last commits
git branch
    lists all the branches
git checkout git-notes
    switched to branch git-notes
git branch
    lists all the branches, and confirms we are on git-notes
touch git_notes.txt
    creates file git_notes.txt
    if it already exists, it updates the modified time
